# Fee-Management-System
This Java Swing program is a Fee Management System that allows users to add students, record their fees and payments, view individual balances, and manage records. It uses tabs for Fee Records, Payments, Balance checks, and Utilities like searching, deleting, summarizing, and clearing all data. Data is stored using Map collections, and the interface updates dynamically using list models and text areas.
